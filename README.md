# Web-Scraper
Python Web Scraper Program
This code uses  the BeautifulSoup (BS4) library to extract information from a website (input by user).

The user is promted to enter the website URL. The program sends a request to that URL and extracts the title of the webpage (if request is successful, i.e. status code 200) using BS4, printing it to the console.

The program also asks if the user if they want to retreive the content of the webpage. If user responds with "y" (yes), it retreives the content through BS4 and printing it to the console in the same way.
